            <h1 className="text-center mt-5">Hello, my name is Tomi!</h1>
            <p className="text-center">Thank you for coming to my website and supporting me! I created this space to combine and showcase two of my passions: web development and crochet. 
                I first picked up crochet during my first year of college as a stress reliever, and it quickly grew into a craft that I love. Over time, I have also explored other fabric arts like knitting and sewing,
                 but crochet will always be my favorite way to create something unique and meaningful. This is a place where you can browse my past projects, see what I am currently working on, and even place requests for custom-made items. 
                 <br />
                 On this website, you’ll find garments and handmade pieces that I’ve created — some available for immediate purchase, and others made custom just for you. Since every item is handmade, things work a little differently here:
                 <br />Some pieces are one-size or universal, i.e. hats, bags, and accessories, are already priced on the site. .<br />
                 For custom garments like dresses, blouses, and skirts, your measurements, preferences, and collaboration are essential. These items are priced individually, based on the materials and work involved.
                 <br />But no worries I will be here every step of the way as I believe the best results come from communication and cooperation. By working closely with you, I can make sure the final product not only fits but also reflects your personal style.
                 Feel free to explore, reach out with your ideas, and let’s create something beautiful together!
